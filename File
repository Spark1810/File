The journey was for almost 10 months. Sharvesh started the journey when he knows to read the alphabets. Now he is 5 Years old and he can confidently read any sentences of his own. Not even one day he said no to attend the class.. Rhymes..and fun time at the class where the best part to keep the children attend the class with enthusiasm. Correct amount of content delivered in each class for them to understand the concept to the fullest. Periodic assessment to thorough the subject. Over all the course was a power-packed very effective and an awesome one. Mrs. Akila took over this course this very effectively and enjoyable for kids.

And this course is worth yhe pay. Mission accomplished




We're so happy that she reads very well and here kids elder than nimisha are not reading like her.

My friends are surprised by seeing her reading English


Thanks for arranging the session. The way she explained it patiently and responded is really gud. Keep up the good work.

Thank you.



The class is so good and easy to understand nga. I thought it's too difficult but not. Shalini taken very boldly. I had distractions now and then by kutties, so i didn't draw. Tomorrow I wil do and send. Convey my thanks to her for d wonderful session


Tridha was upset to know it was her last class with you. She had enjoyed and learned a lot from these lessons. A warm gratitude from our end ma'am.




Thanks Akila for helping Mithran to learn phonics.. Kids will miss you a lot..






As this Phonics class comes to an end, I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you @Akila Arun for your dedication, patience, and incredible teaching. Your guidance has made a huge difference, helping Aarav build confidence in reading and pronunciation.

We truly appreciate the effort you put into making learning engaging and enjoyable. Your passion for teaching and the way you support each student has been inspiring. Thanks to you, we have seen remarkable progress, and we are grateful for the foundation you have provided.

Thank you once again for all your hard work, encouragement, and the positive impact you have had. We feel fortunate to have been part of your class!

Wishing you all the best, and we hope to stay in touch.

Last but not the least, Thank You Subhan @ Shailja for referring this class..
